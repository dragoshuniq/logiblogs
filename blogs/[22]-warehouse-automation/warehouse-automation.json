Over half of the professional service robots sold were for transportation and logistics applications, with sales in this category growing by 35%. Labour shortages are a key driver: automated loading and unloading robots reduce the time drivers spend on manual tasks. The IFR also notes that Germany is home to 83 service and medical robot manufacturers and that Europe hosts about 44% of the world's service robot producers.",
