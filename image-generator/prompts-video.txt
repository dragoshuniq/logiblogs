60 second 16:9 ultra-realistic cinematic road ad for Logifie (European logistics company, owns Volvo FH curtain-side tautliner 13.6m trucks). Consistent livery: cabins painted vertical gradient #E63946 (top) to #1D3557 (bottom), glossy clearcoat, exact Logifie logo on cab doors and sun visor. Trailers: white curtain with dark blue #1D3557 horizontal band across lower middle, big Logifie logo on upper white area toward front, inside the band left side bold white text "logifie.com", right side white slogan "Inspired by People. Powered by AI. Delivered by Logifie". Keep brand colors and logos perfectly accurate across all scenes. Clean, premium look, subtle film grain, crisp audio implied, smooth camera work.

Scene 1 (0-8s) coastal sunrise: drone sweep along a cliffside European coastal highway, waves crashing below, soft fog. A lead Logifie truck glides through the curve. Lower-third text fade-in: "Logifie. Built for European logistics." Transition: aerial tilt to road level.

Scene 2 (8-16s) alpine morning: truck climbs a winding alpine pass with snow-capped peaks and low sun haloing the cab. Tire mist kicks up in the cool air. Transition: match-cut on wheel spin.

Scene 3 (16-24s) city ring road daytime: dual branded trucks cruise a modern European ring road, skyline and glass towers reflecting on glossy paint, tram lines and overpasses adding depth. Transition: whip pan to bridge.

Scene 4 (24-32s) golden hour suspension bridge: hero truck crosses a sweeping suspension bridge over a wide river, sun flare streaks, cables creating graphic lines. Transition: lens flare wipe into forest road.

Scene 5 (32-40s) twilight forest highway: truck rolls through dense evergreen forest, light shafts through trees, light drizzle creating fine spray off tires. Transition: POV cut to tunnel.

Scene 6 (40-48s) night tunnel: interior tunnel POV with sodium lights streaking overhead, subtle reflections on windshield, engine hum deep and steady. Transition: exit flash to rain.

Scene 7 (48-56s) rainy autobahn night: two trucks overtake in parallel on wet autobahn, headlight and taillight light trails, wind turbines silhouetted on horizon. Transition: cross-dissolve to night overlook.

Scene 8 (56-60s) night overlook hero: truck parked at a scenic turnout above a cityscape of lights, gentle rain, wet asphalt reflections. Text overlay: "Delivered by Logifie." End frame: Logifie logo lockup on gradient background (#E63946 to #1D3557) with full slogan "Inspired by People. Powered by AI. Delivered by Logifie." and CTA: "logifie.com".

General directions: buttery-smooth gimbal, car-mount, and drone moves; natural lens flares; realistic engine hum, tire hiss, and wind; wet road reflections where applicable. Maintain consistent truck model, paint, trailer banding, logos, URL, and slogan in every shot. Use tasteful, quick transitions (match-cuts, whip pans, flare wipes, cross-dissolves). Keep pacing energetic but premium; finish on a strong brand lockup with the Logifie logo and full slogan.

Voiceover (text-to-speech script, calm confident European English voice, warm tone, measured pace):
1) "Logifie. Built for European logistics."
2) "We connect roads across coastlines, cities, and alpine passes with precision."
3) "Our fleet is powered by people and enabled by AI."
4) "Every route. Every schedule. Every delivery—engineered for reliability."
5) "Inspired by people. Powered by AI. Delivered by Logifie."

Music and sound design: original cinematic score starting minimal at coastal sunrise (soft pads, light piano), building a driving rhythm with muted percussion for alpine climb and city ring road, adding tasteful analog synth pulses on the bridge and tunnel, then tightening into a pulsing bassline and strings for rainy autobahn. Natural SFX throughout: ocean surf near cliffs, distant alpine wind, city ambience, bridge cable hum, forest rustle with drizzle, tunnel whoosh, wet road spray, low engine rumble and air brakes. Duck SFX under voiceover; let the final slogan land clean over a brief musical swell and resolve.***
