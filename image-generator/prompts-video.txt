60 second 16:9 ultra-realistic cinematic advertisement for Logifie (European logistics company, owns Volvo FH curtain-side tautliner 13.6m trucks). Consistent livery: cabins painted vertical gradient #E63946 (top) to #1D3557 (bottom), glossy clearcoat, exact Logifie logo on cab doors and sun visor. Trailers: white curtain with dark blue #1D3557 horizontal band across lower middle, big Logifie logo on upper white area toward front, inside the band left side bold white text "logifie.com", right side white slogan "Inspired by People. Powered by AI. Delivered by Logifie". Keep brand colors and logos perfectly accurate across all scenes. Clean, premium look, subtle film grain, crisp audio implied, smooth camera work.

Scene 1 (0-8s) aerial sunrise: drone rise over a foggy European logistics campus with solar-paneled warehouses; reveal multiple branded trucks in formation. Slow push-in. Lower-third text fade-in: "Logifie. Built for European logistics."

Scene 2 (8-16s) highway motion: tracking shot beside two branded trucks cruising on a German autobahn, dusk blue-hour sky, wind turbines on rolling hills, light rain mist creating light streaks. Motion blur on wheels, reflections on wet asphalt. Transition: match-cut on wheel spin.

Scene 3 (16-24s) port night: crane silhouettes and stacked containers, sodium vapor floodlights. One branded truck pulls from a bay, wet ground mirrors lights. Transition: whip pan to next yard.

Scene 4 (24-32s) warehouse loading: interior LED-lit dock, forklift slides a wrapped pallet into trailer via dock leveler, volumetric light beams. Transition: rack focus to driver.

Scene 5 (32-40s) driver handshake: confident Logifie driver in navy #1D3557 jacket with #E63946 piping, radio earpiece, shakes hands with client holding tablet; truck blurred in background. Text overlay center: "Inspired by People. Powered by AI."

Scene 6 (40-48s) control room: operations center with wall of live route maps and KPIs in brand colors; glass wall overlooks yard of branded trucks. Transition: digital HUD swipe to route map.

Scene 7 (48-56s) alpine crossing: truck cresting a snowy alpine pass at golden hour, breath vapor visible, crisp cold air haze. Transition: cross-dissolve to night yard.

Scene 8 (56-60s) night yard hero: rain-kissed yard under floodlights, hero truck angled to camera with wet reflections. Text overlay: "Delivered by Logifie." End frame: logo lockup on gradient background (#E63946 to #1D3557), CTA: "logifie.com".

General directions: buttery-smooth gimbal and drone moves, natural lens flares, realistic engine hum and ambient yard sounds. Maintain consistent truck model, paint, trailer banding, logos, URL, and slogan in every shot. Use tasteful, quick transitions (match-cuts, whip pans, cross-dissolves). Keep pacing energetic but premium; finish on strong brand lockup.

Voiceover (text-to-speech script, calm confident European English voice, warm tone, measured pace):
1) "Logifie. Built for European logistics."
2) "We connect warehouses, ports, and borders with precision."
3) "Our fleet is powered by people and enabled by AI."
4) "Every route. Every schedule. Every delivery—engineered for reliability."
5) "Inspired by people. Powered by AI. Delivered by Logifie."

Music and sound design: original cinematic score starting minimal at sunrise (soft pads, light piano), building driving rhythm with muted percussion during highway and port scenes, adding subtle analog synth pulses in control room, then tapering to a confident resolve on the night yard hero shot. Natural SFX throughout: distant seagulls at port, forklift beeps and pallet slides in warehouse, gentle wind and tire hiss on autobahn, light rain patter on night yard, low engine hum and air brakes. Duck SFX under voiceover for clarity; let final slogan land clean over a brief musical swell and resolve.***
